# Web Browser


## Software vs Webpage

In many cases, entire applications (e.g. IDEs, games) live on webpages nowadays.
To combat this installing software must be made simpler and more secure, so that browsers don't turn into entire virtual machines.
This can be archived by using the isolation techniques from the [Operating System](OPERATING_SYSTEM.md) page (permissions etc.), 
and a powerful GUI API, to make it accessible to web devs.


## Modularity

To reduce the amount of things a browser can and must do it is important to split it up; 
this becomes very important in the fight against monopolies, by providing the user with a choice and creates healthy competition.

A special wayland-like *(check)* window tiling manager could provide the necessary functionality to embed the users chosen 
video player inside a webpage.


### Scrambled thoughts
- Google monopoly
- Maybe kill the concept of tabs and just use separate windows (probably a bad idea)
